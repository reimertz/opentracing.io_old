OpenTracing also offers a lingua franca for OSS instrumentation and platform-specific tracing helper libraries. Please refer to the Semantic Specification.\nWhat is a Trace?\nAt the highest level, a trace tells the story of a transaction or workflow as it propagates through a (potentially distributed) system. In OpenTracing, a trace is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of \"spans\": named, timed operations representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace.\n\nEach component in a distributed trace will contribute its own span or spans. In the case of a trivial RPC, for instance, OpenTracing expects both the client and server to represent their respective role in the workflow as at least one span.\n\nA parent span may explicitly start other spans, either in serial or in parallel. In OpenTracing, it is even possible to model a child span with multiple parents (e.g., a buffer flush may descend from the multiple writes that filled said buffer).\nA Basic Trace\n\nTracing a workflow or transaction through a distributed system often looks something like the above. While this type of visualization can be useful to see how various components fit together, it does not convey any time durations, does not scale well, and is cumbersome when parallelism is involved. Another limitation is that there is no way to easily show latency or other aspects of timing. A more useful way to visualize even a basic trace often looks like this:\n\nThis type of visualization adds the context of time, the hierarchy of the services involved, and the serial or parallel nature of the process/task execution. This view helps to highlight the system's critical path. By focusing on the critical path, attention can focus on the area of code where the most valuable improvements can be made. For example, you might want to trace the resource allocation spans inside an API request down to the underlying blocking calls.\n"},"pages/quick-start.html":{"url":"pages/quick-start.html","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Distributed Tracing in 10 Minutes\noriginally posted on OpenTracing blog\nWith the intrinsic concurrency and asynchrony of modern software applications, distributed tracing has become part of the table stakes for effective monitoring. That said, instrumenting a system for tracing has, at least historically, been a labor-intensive, complicated task. Tracing brings the benefits of visibility into an application as it grows to 10+ processes, starts seeing increased concurrency, or non-trivial interactions between mobile/web clients and servers. But setting up instrumentation and deciding which tracer to use can add up to a large project. The OpenTracing standard changes that, making it possible to instrument applications for distributed tracing with minimal effort. As I demonstrate below, you can now easily set up tracing in less than 10 minutes with OpenTracing.\n\nA screencast of the example app built in this post\nImagine a simple website. Whenever a user goes to your home page, the web server makes two HTTP calls, and each of those calls branches out and makes a call to the database. This is fairly straightforward and debugging any slow requests wouldn’t be too difficult. If you are serious about latency, you might assign each request a unique ID and propagate it downstream through HTTP headers. If a request took a long time, you can then grep over the log files for that request ID to figure out what was going on. Now imagine your website starts becoming popular and your application is spread across multiple machines and services. As the number of machines and services grow, logs provide less and less visibility. Determining causality gets tricky pretty quickly. This is when you realize workflow tracing would have more than worth the investment.\nAs I mentioned, OpenTracing steps in to make it very easy for you to trace because it standardizes instrumentation. What that means is that you can instrument first and defer most implementation decisions to later.\nYou can follow my entire process below — from building the web app to seeing the traces in AppDash, the open source distributed tracing system I chose. Alternatively, you can skip ahead and see the finished result with Appdash. To do that, run\ndocker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 -p 8700:8700 bg451/opentracing-example\nThis will spin up the test server and a local Appdash instance. The source code can be found at here.\nFor those who want to see the full story, you can go through the full exercise of building the web app, instrumenting it with OpenTracing, binding to a tracer, AppDash, and finally seeing the traces, in this blog post.\nBuilding the web app\nTo start off, write a few simple endpoints:\n// Acts as our index page\nfunc indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    w.Write([]byte(` Click here to start a request `))\n}\nfunc homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n     w.Write([]byte(\"Request started\"))\n    go func() {\n        http.Get(\"http://localhost:8080/async\")\n    }()\n    http.Get(\"http://localhost:8080/service\")\n    time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond)\n    w.Write([]byte(\"Request done!\"))\n}\n// Mocks a service endpoint that makes a DB call\nfunc serviceHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // ...\n    http.Get(\"http://localhost:8080/db\")\n    time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond)\n    // ...\n}\n// Mocks a DB call\nfunc dbHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond)\n    // here would be the actual call to a DB.\n}\n\nPut this all together into a working server.\nfunc main() {\n    port := 8080\n    addr := fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", port)\n    mux := http.NewServeMux()\n    mux.HandleFunc(\"/\", indexHandler)\n    mux.HandleFunc(\"/home\", homeHandler)\n    mux.HandleFunc(\"/async\", serviceHandler)\n    mux.HandleFunc(\"/service\", serviceHandler)\n    mux.HandleFunc(\"/db\", dbHandler)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Go to http://localhost:%d/home to start a request!\\n\", port)\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(addr, mux))\n}\n\nThrow everything into main.go file and run: go run main.go.\nInstrument the app\nNow that you have a working web server, you can start instrumenting it. Start at the top level and work your way down. You can start a span and finish it like so:\nfunc homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  span := opentracing.StartSpan(\"/home\") // Start a span using the global, in this case noop, tracer\n  defer span.Finish()\n  // ... the rest of the function\n}\n\nThis span records how long it takes homeHandler to complete, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of information that you can record. OpenTracing enables you to attach tags and logs to an individual span. For instance, you can specify whether or not a span contains an error inside homeHandler:\n// The ext package provides a set of standardized tags available for use.\nimport \"github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go/ext\"\n\nfunc homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n// ...\n// We record any errors now.\n    _, err := http.Get(\"http://localhost:8080/service\")\n    if err != nil {\n        ext.Error.Set(span, true) // Tag the span as errored\n        span.LogEventWithPayload(\"GET service error\", err) // Log the error\n    }\n// ...\n}\n\nYou can record other things as well, including important events, the user ID, and the browser type.\nHowever, that’s only for one function. To build true end-to-end traces, you’ll want to include spans for the client side of the HTTP calls. In our example, you need to start propagating span contexts downstream to the other endpoints now, and those endpoints need to be able to join traces. This is where the Inject/Extract part of the API comes into play. homeHandler creates a \"root\" span since it’s the first thing to get called. You will start there and work your way down.\nfunc homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    w.Write([]byte(\"Request started\"))\n    span := opentracing.StartSpan(\"/home\")\n    defer span.Finish()\n\n    // Since we have to inject our span into the HTTP headers, we create a request\n    asyncReq, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://localhost:8080/async\", nil)\n    // Inject the span context into the header\n    err := span.Tracer().Inject(span.Context(),\n        opentracing.TextMap,\n        opentracing.HTTPHeaderTextMapCarrier(asyncReq.Header))\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Could not inject span context into header: %v\", err)\n    }\n    go func() {\n        if _, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(asyncReq); err != nil {\n            span.SetTag(\"error\", true)\n            span.LogEvent(fmt.Sprintf(\"GET /async error: %v\", err))\n        }\n    }()\n    // Repeat for the /service call.\n    // ....\n}\n\nWhat happens underneath is that the underlying implementation injects a span’s metadata about the current trace into the request’s headers to be read by anyone downstream. Go ahead and extract that data in serviceHandler.\nfunc serviceHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    var sp opentracing.Span\n    opName := r.URL.Path\n    // Attempt to join a trace by getting trace context from the headers.\n    wireContext, err := opentracing.GlobalTracer().Extract(\n        opentracing.TextMap,\n        opentracing.HTTPHeaderTextMapCarrier(r.Header))\n    if err != nil {\n        // If for whatever reason we can't join, go ahead an start a new root span.\n        sp = opentracing.StartSpan(opName)\n    } else {\n        sp = opentracing.StartSpan(opName, opentracing.ChildOf(wireContext))\n    }\n  defer sp.Finish()\n  // ... rest of the function\n\nAnd that’s it! If you repeat the steps above for things you want to trace, you should have a fully instrumented system fairly quickly. To decide what needs be traced, you should look at your requests’ critical paths.\nConnect the tracer\nOne of the great things about OpenTracing is that once your system is instrumented, adding a tracer is really straightforward! In this example, you can see that I’ve used Appdash, an open source tracing system. There’s small chunk of code needed inside your main function to start the Appdash instance. However, you won’t need to touch any of your instrumentation code at all. In your main function, add:\nimport (\n    \"sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/appdash\"\n    “sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/appdash/traceapp”\n    appdashot \"sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/appdash/opentracing\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // ...\n      store := appdash.NewMemoryStore()\n\n    // Listen on any available TCP port locally.\n    l, err := net.ListenTCP(\"tcp\", &net.TCPAddr{IP: net.IPv4(127, 0, 0, 1), Port: 0})\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    collectorPort := l.Addr().(*net.TCPAddr).Port\n    collectorAdd := fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", collectorPort)\n\n    // Start an Appdash collection server that will listen for spans and\n    // annotations and add them to the local collector (stored in-memory).\n    cs := appdash.NewServer(l, appdash.NewLocalCollector(store))\n    go cs.Start()\n\n    // Print the URL at which the web UI will be running.\n    appdashPort := 8700\n    appdashURLStr := fmt.Sprintf(\"http://localhost:%d\", appdashPort)\n    appdashURL, err := url.Parse(appdashURLStr)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Error parsing %s: %s\", appdashURLStr, err)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"To see your traces, go to %s/traces\\n\", appdashURL)\n\n    // Start the web UI in a separate goroutine.\n    tapp, err := traceapp.New(nil, appdashURL)\n    if err != nil {\n         log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    tapp.Store = store\n    tapp.Queryer = store\n    go func() {\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", appdashPort), tapp))\n    }()\n\n    tracer := appdashot.NewTracer(appdash.NewRemoteCollector(collectorPort))\n    opentracing.InitGlobalTracer(tracer)\n// ...\n}\n\nThis will create an embedded Appdash instance and serve traces locally.\n\nShould you want to change your tracer implementation, it is a O(1) change because of OpenTracing. All you need to do is update your main function; the rest of your instrumentation stays the same. For example, if you decide to use Zipkin later on, this is all you would need to do in your main function:\nimport zipkin \"github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-go-opentracing\"\n\nfunc main() {\n  // ...\n  // Replace Appdash tracer code with this\n  collector, err := zipkin.NewKafkaCollector(\"ZIPKIN_ADDR\")\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n    return\n  }\n\n  tracer, err = zipkin.NewTracer(\n    zipkin.NewRecorder(collector, false, \"localhost:8000\", \"example\"),\n  )\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  opentracing.InitGlobalTracer(tracer)\n  // ...\n}\n\nHaving made it thus far, you can see that instrumenting your code for tracing is much easier with OpenTracing. I recommend this as a best practice whenever starting out on an app. That’s because by setting up tracing even when your application is small, trace data can guide your development strategy as you grow. Having visibility into your processes as they start to mature and increase in complexity will help you build a sustainable product.\n"},"pages/api/":{"url":"pages/api/","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"API\n\nAPI Implementations\nData Conventions\nAcross Process Tracing\n\n"},"pages/api/api-implementations.html":{"url":"pages/api/api-implementations.html","title":"API Implementations","keywords":"","body":"Integration APIs\nOpenTracing APIs are available for the following platforms:\n\nGo (1.0RC) - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go\nPython (1.0RC) - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python\nJavascript (1.0RC) - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-javascript\nObjective-C - (1.0RC) - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-objc\nJava - (1.0RC) - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java\nC++ - https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp\n\nOpenTracing APIs are in progress for the following platforms:\n\nPHP - link forthcoming\nRuby - link forthcoming\n\nPlease refer to the README files in the respective per-platform repositories for usage examples.\nCommunity contributions are welcome for other languages at any time.\n\n\nWhat does \"1.0RC\" mean?\nIt means that the contributors have spent a while thinking through the APIs from above and below, prototyped bindings to several tracing systems and many calling contexts, and have converged on semantics for the various OpenTracing platform APIs.\n1.0RC means that we feel comfortable formally binding OpenTracing to production tracing systems and production application code: not just in dev branches, but in public PRs.

In general, there is no guarantee made by OpenTracing about the way that data will be handled by an underlying tracer. So what type of data should be provided to the APIs in order to best ensure compatibility across tracer implementations?\nA high-level understanding between the instrumentor and tracer developers adds great value: if certain known tag key/values are used for common application scenarios, tracers can choose to pay special attention to them. The same is true of logged events, and span structure in general.\nAs an example, consider the common case of a HTTP-based application server. The URL of an incoming request that the application is handling is often useful for diagnostics, as well as the HTTP verb and the resultant status code. An instrumentor could choose to report the URL in a tag named URL, or perhaps named http.url--either would be valid from the pure API perspective. But if the Tracer wishes to add intelligence, such as indexing on the URL value or sampling proactively for requests to a particular endpoint, it must know where to look for relevant data. In short, when tag names and other instrumentor-provided values are used consistently, the tracers on the other side of the API can employ more intelligence.\nThe guidelines provided here describe a common ground on which instrumentors and tracer authors can build beyond pure data collection. Adherence to the guidelines is optional but highly recommended for instrumentors.\nSpans\nSpan Naming\nSpans carry tags, logs, and baggage, but they also have a top-level operation name. This should be a low-cardinality string value representing the type of work being done in the span. Typically, this is the local type of work being done. Examples include an RPC or endpoint name for a HTTP span, SELECT or INSERT for a SQL span, and so on.\nSecondarily, an optional component tag can be provided to scope the operation name. Typically, a process, framework, library, or module name is a good guideline for the component tag.\nSpan Structure\nSpan structure is also important: what do spans represent, and what relationship do they have towards their ancestors?  This is covered in the Semantic Specification.\nSpan Tag Use-Cases\nThe following tags are recommended for instrumentors who are trying to represent a particular type of data. Tag names follow a general structure of namespacing.\nThe recommended tags below are accompanied by const values included in an ext module for each opentracing implementation.  These ext values should be used in place of the strings below, as tracers may choose to use different underlying representations for these common concepts.  The symbols are similar in each implementation: (Go, Python, etc.)\nSome tags mentioned below may contain values of significant size. Handling of such values is implementation-specific: it is the responsibility of the Tracer to honor, drop, or truncate these tags as appropriate. However, care should be exercised on the part of the instrumentor, as even the generation or passing of such values to the Tracer may create undesirable overhead for the application.\nIt is not required that all suggested tags be used, even if one is used.\nErrors\nThe error state of a span instance should be represented as a tag.\n\nerror - bool\ntrue means that the span is in an error state\nfalse or the absence of an error tag means that the span is not in an error state\n\n\n\nComponent Identification\nFor any span, it can be useful to specify the type of component being instrumented. This is particularly recommended for instrumentation provided for libraries or modules, where end-users may have a mix of custom and library-provided instrumentation.\n\ncomponent - string\nLow-cardinality identifier of the module, library, or package that is instrumented.\nExamples:\nhttplib for instrumentation of Python builtin httplib functionality\nJDBC for instrumentation of JDBC database connectors\nmongoose for instrumentation of Ruby MongoDB client connector\n\n\n\n\nspan.kind - string\nOne of client or server, indicating if this span represents a client or server\n\n\n\nHTTP Server Tags\nThese tags are recommended for spans marking entry into a HTTP-based service.\n\nhttp.url - string\nURL of the request being handled in this segment of the trace, in standard URI format.\nProtocol optional\nExamples:\nhttps://domain.net/path/to?resource=here\ndomain.net/path/to/resource\nhttp://user:pass@domain.org:8888\n\n\n\n\nhttp.method - string\nHTTP method of the request being handled.\nCase-insensitive\nExamples:\nGET, POST, HEAD\n\n\n\n\nhttp.status_code - integer\nHTTP status code to be returned with HTTP response.\nExamples:\n200, 503\n\n\n\n\nspan.kind - string\nValue of server should be used to indicate that this is a server-side span (see \"Component Identification\")\n\n\n\nPeer Tags\nThese tags can be provided by either client-side or server-side to describe the downstream (client case) or upstream (server case) peer being communicated with.\n\npeer.hostname - string\nRemote hostname\n\n\npeer.ipv4 - string\nRemote IP v4 address\n\n\npeer.ipv6 - string\nRemote IP v6 address\n\n\npeer.port - integer\nRemote port\n\n\npeer.service - string\nRemote service name\n\n\n\nSampling\nOpenTracing API does not enforce the notion of sampling, but most implementation do use it in one form or another. Sometimes the application needs to give a hint to the tracer that it would like to have a particular trace recorded in storage even if the normal sampling says otherwise. The sampling.priority tag is used to provide such hint. Tracing implementations are not required to respect the hint, but most will do their best to preserve the trace.\n\nsampling.priority - integer\nIf greater than 0, a hint to the tracer to do its best to capture the trace.\nIf 0, a hint to the tracer to not capture the trace.\nIf this tag is not provided, the tracer should use its default sampling mechanism.\n\n\n\n"},"pages/api/across-process-tracing.html":{"url":"pages/api/across-process-tracing.html","title":"Across Process Tracing","keywords":"","body":"Everything You Wanted to Know About Inject and Extract but were Afraid to Ask\nProgrammers adding tracing support across process boundaries must understand the Tracer.Inject(...) and Tracer.Extract(...) capabilities of the OpenTracing specification. They are conceptually powerful, allowing the programmer to write correct and general cross-process propagation code without being bound to a particular OpenTracing implementation; that said, with great power comes great opportunity for confusion. :)\nThis document provides a concise summary of the design and proper use of Inject and Extract, regardless of the particular OpenTracing language or OpenTracing implementation.\n\"The Big Picture\" for explicit trace propagation\nThe hardest thing about distributed tracing is the distributed part. Any tracing system needs a way of understanding the causal relationship between activities in many distinct processes, whether they be connected via formal RPC frameworks, pub-sub systems, generic message queues, ad hoc HTTP calls, best-effort UDP packets, or something else entirely.\nSome distributed tracing systems (e.g., Project5 from 2003, or WAP5 from 2006 or The Mystery Machine from 2014) infer causal relationships across process boundaries. Of course there is a tradeoff between the apparent convenience of these black-box inference-based approaches and the freshness and quality of the assembled traces. Per the concern about quality, OpenTracing is an explicit distributed tracing instrumentation standard, and as such it is much better-aligned with approaches like X-Trace from 2007, Dapper from 2010, or numerous open-source tracing systems like Zipkin or Appdash (among others).\nLet's briefly restate the \"Why OpenTracing?\" section of the OpenTracing landing page:\n\nBy offering consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for popular platforms, OpenTracing makes it easy for developers to add (or switch) tracing implementations with an O(1) configuration change. OpenTracing also offers a lingua franca for OSS instrumentation and platform-specific tracing helper libraries.\n\nTogether, Inject and Extract allow for inter-process trace propagation without tightly coupling the programmer to a particular OpenTracing implementation.\nRequirements for the OpenTracing propagation scheme\nFor Inject and Extract to be useful, all of the following must be true:\n\nPer the above, the OpenTracing user handling cross-process trace propagation must not need to write OpenTracing-implementation-specific code\nOpenTracing implementations must not need special handlers for every known inter-process communication mechanism: that's far too much work, and it's not even well-defined\nThat said, the propagation mechanism should be extensible for optimizations\n\nThe basic approach: Inject, Extract, and Carriers\nAny SpanContext in a trace may be Injected into what OpenTracing refers to as a Carrier. A Carrier is an interface or data structure that's useful for inter-process communication (IPC); that is, the Carrier is something that \"carries\" the tracing state from one process to another. The OpenTracing specification includes two required Carrier formats, though custom Carrier formats are possible as well.\nSimilarly, given a Carrier, an injected trace may be Extracted, yielding a SpanContext instance which is semantically identical to the one Injected into the Carrier.\nInject pseudocode example\nspan_context = ...\noutbound_request = ...\n\n# We'll use the (builtin) TEXT_MAP carrier format. We start by\n# using an empty map as the carrier prior to the call to\n# `tracer.inject`.\ncarrier = {}\ntracer.inject(span_context, opentracing.Format.TEXT_MAP, carrier)\n\n# `carrier` now contains (opaque) key:value pairs which we pass\n# along over whatever wire protocol we already use.\nfor key, value in carrier:\n    outbound_request.headers[key] = escape(value)\n\nExtract pseudocode example\ninbound_request = ...\n\n# We'll again use the (builtin) TEXT_MAP carrier format. Per the\n# TEXT_MAP documentation, we can use a map that has extraneous data\n# in it and let the OpenTracing implementation look for the subset\n# of key:value pairs it needs.\n#\n# As such, we directly use the key:value `inbound_request.headers`\n# map as the carrier.\ncarrier = inbound_request.headers\nspan_context = tracer.extract(opentracing.Format.TEXT_MAP, carrier)\n# Continue the trace given span_context. E.g.,\nspan = tracer.start_span(\"...\", child_of=span_context)\n\n# (If `carrier` held trace data, `span` will now be ready to use.)\n\nCarriers have formats\nAll Carriers have a format. In some OpenTracing languages, the format must be specified explicitly as a constant or string; in others, the format is inferred from the Carrier's static type information.\n\n\nRequired Inject/Extract Carrier formats\nAt a minimum, all platforms require OpenTracing implementations to support two Carrier formats: the \"text map\" format and the \"binary\" format.\n\nThe text map Carrier format is a platform-idiomatic map from (unicode) string to string\nThe binary Carrier format is an opaque byte array (and presumably more compact and efficient)\n\nWhat the OpenTracing implementations choose to store in these Carriers is not formally defined by the OpenTracing specification, but the presumption is that they find a way to encode \"tracer state\" about the propagated SpanContext (e.g., in Dapper this would include a trace_id, a span_id, and a bitmask representing the sampling status for the given trace) as well as any key:value Baggage items.\nInteroperability of OpenTracing implementations across process boundaries\nThere is no expectation that different OpenTracing implementations Inject and Extract SpanContexts in compatible ways. Though OpenTracing is agnostic about the tracing implementation across an entire distributed system, for successful inter-process handoff it's essential that the processes on both sides of a propagation use the same tracing implementation.\n\n\nCustom Inject/Extract Carrier formats\nAny propagation subsystem (an RPC library, a message queue, etc) may choose to introduce their own custom Inject/Extract Carrier format; by preferring their custom format but falling back to a required OpenTracing format as needed they allow OpenTracing implementations to optimize for their custom format without needing OpenTracing implementations to support their format.\nSome pseudocode will make this less abstract. Imagine that we're the author of the (sadly fictitious) ArrrPC pirate RPC subsystem, and we want to add OpenTracing support to our outbound RPC requests. Minus some error handling, our pseudocode might look like this:\nspan_context = ...\noutbound_request = ...\n\n# First we try our custom Carrier, the outbound_request itself.\n# If the underlying OpenTracing implementation cares to support\n# it, this call is presumably more efficient in this process\n# and over the wire. But, since this is a non-required format,\n# we must also account for the possibility that the OpenTracing\n# implementation does not support arrrpc.ARRRPC_OT_CARRIER.\ntry:\n    tracer.inject(span_context, arrrpc.ARRRPC_OT_CARRIER, outbound_request)\n\nexcept opentracing.UnsupportedFormatException:\n    # If unsupported, fall back on a required OpenTracing format.\n    carrier = {}\n    tracer.inject(span_context, opentracing.Format.TEXT_MAP, carrier)\n    # `carrier` now contains (opaque) key:value pairs which we\n    # pass along over whatever wire protocol we already use.\n    for key, value in carrier:\n    outbound_request.headers[key] = escape(value)\n\n\n\nMore about custom Carrier formats\nThe precise representation of the \"Carrier formats\" may vary from platform to platform, but in all cases they should be drawn from a global namespace. Support for a new custom carrier format must not necessitate changes to the core OpenTracing platform APIs, though each OpenTracing platform API must define the required OpenTracing carrier formats (e.g., string maps and binary blobs). For example, if the maintainer of ArrrPC RPC framework wanted to define an \"ArrrPC\" Inject/Extract format, she or he must be able to do so without sending a PR to OpenTracing maintainers (though of course OpenTracing implementations are not required to support the \"ArrrPC\" format). There is an end-to-end injector and extractor example below to make this more concrete.\n\n\nAn end-to-end Inject and Extract propagation example\nTo make the above more concrete, consider the following sequence:\n\nA client process has a SpanContext instance and is about to make an RPC over a home-grown HTTP protocol\nThat client process calls Tracer.Inject(...), passing the active SpanContext instance, a format identifier for a text map, and a text map Carrier as parameters\nInject has populated the text map in the Carrier; the client application encodes that map within its homegrown HTTP protocol (e.g., as headers)\nThe HTTP request happens and the data crosses process boundaries...\nNow in the server process, the application code decodes the text map from the homegrown HTTP protocol and uses it to initialize a text map Carrier\nThe server process calls Tracer.Extract(...), passing in the desired operation name, a format identifier for a text map, and the Carrier from above\nIn the absence of data corruption or other errors, the server now has a SpanContext instance that belongs to the same trace as the one in the client\n\nOther examples can be found in the OpenTracing use cases doc.\n"},"pages/instrumentation/":{"url":"pages/instrumentation/","title":"Instrumentation","keywords":"","body":"Instrumentation\n\nInstrumenting Large Systems\nCommon Use Cases\nInstrumenting Frameworks\n\n"},"pages/instrumentation/instrumenting-large-systems.html":{"url":"pages/instrumentation/instrumenting-large-systems.html","title":"Instrumenting Large Systems","keywords":"","body":"How to Instrument Systems at Scale\nBefore getting onto recommendations on how to instrument your large-scale system with OpenTracing, be sure to read the Specification overview.\nSpans and Relationships\nThe two fundamental aspects of implementing OpenTracing across your infrastructure are Spans and the Relationships between those spans:\n\nSpan is a logical unit of work in the system that has a start time and a duration. In a trace Spans are associated with the components of the system as they are exercised on a specified path.\n\n\nRelationships are the connections between Spans. A Span may reference zero or more Spans that are causally related. This allows for the spans to be connected and help identify the critical path of a trace.\n\n\n\nYour desired end state is to get Spans for all or your code components as well as the relationships between those Spans. When starting to build out your infrastructure with distributed tracing the best practice is to start with service frameworks (i.e. RPC layer) or other components known to have broad interaction with multiple execution paths.\nBy using a service framework that is instrumented with OpenTracing (gRPC, etc.) you can get a head start on this effort. However, if you are working with a non-instrumented framework you can get some assistance with this part by reading the IPC/RPC Framework Guide.\nFocus on Areas of Value\nAs mentioned above, start with your RPC layers and your web framework to provide a good foundation for your instrumentation. Both of these will likely have a large coverage area and touch a significant number of transaction paths.\nNext you should look for areas of your infrastructure on the path of a transaction not covered by your service framework. Instrument enough of these code components to create a trace along the critical path of a high value transaction.\nBy prioritizing based on the Spans in your transaction on the critical path and consume the greatest time, there is the greatest opportunity for measurable optimization. For example, adding detailed instrumentation to a span making up 1% of the total transaction time is unlikely to provide meaningful gains in your understanding of end-to-end latency.\nCrawl, Walk, Run\nAs you are implementing tracing across your system, the key to building value is to balance completing some well-articulated high value traces with the notion of total code coverage. The greatest value is going to come from building just enough coverage to generate end-to-end traces for some number of high-value transactions. It is important to visualize your instrumentation as early as possible. This will help you identify areas that need further visibility.\nOnce you have an end-to-end trace, you can evaluate and prioritize areas where greater visibility will be worth the level of effort for the additional instrumentation. As you start to dig deeper, look for the units of work that can be reused. An example of this would be instrumenting a library that is used across multiple services.\nThis approach often leads to broad coverage (RPC, web frameworks, etc) while also adding high-value spans to business-critical transactions. Even if the instrumentation for specific spans involve one-off work, patterns will emerge that will assist in optimizing prioritization of future work.\nConceptual Example\nHere is an example of this progression to make the approach more tangible:\nFor this example we want to trace a request initiated by a mobile client and propagating through a small constellation of backend services.\n\nFirst, we must identify the overall flow of the transaction. In our example, the transactions look like this:\n\nStart with a user action that creates a web request from a mobile client (HTTP) → web tier (RPC) → auth service (RPC) → billing service (RPC) → resource request (API) → response to web tier (API) → response to client (HTTP)\n\nNow that we have high-level conceptual understanding of a transaction flow we can look to instrument a few of the broader protocols and frameworks. The best choice will be to start with the RPC service since this will be an easy way to gather  spans for everything happening behind the web service (or at least everything leveraging the RPC service directly).\n\nThe next component that makes sense to instrument is the web framework. By adding the web framework we are able to then have an end-to-end trace. It may be rough, but at least the full workflow can be captured by our tracing system.\n\n\nAt this point we want to take a look at the trace and evaluate where our efforts will provide the greatest value. In our example we can see the area that has the greatest delay for this request is the time it takes for resources to be allocated. This is likely a good place to start adding more granular visibility into the allocation process and instrument the components involved. Once we instrument the resource API we see that resource request can be broken down into:\n\nresource request (API) → container startup (API) → storage allocation (API) → startup scripts (API) → resource ready response (API)\n\nOnce we have instrumented the resource allocation process components, we can see that the bulk of the time is during resource provisioning. The next step would be to go a bit deeper and look to see if there were optimizations that could be done in this process. Maybe we could provision resources in parallel rather than in serial.\n\n\nNow that there is visibility and an established baseline for an end-to-end workflow, we can articulate a realistic external SLO for that request. In addition, articulating SLO’s for internal services can also become part of the conversation about uptime and error budgets.\n\nThe next iteration would be to go back to the top level of the trace and look for other large spans that appear to lack visibility and apply more granular instrumentation. If instead the visibility is sufficient, the next step would be to move on to another transaction.\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\n\n"},"pages/instrumentation/common-use-cases.html":{"url":"pages/instrumentation/common-use-cases.html","title":"Common Use Cases","keywords":"","body":"Commom use cases\nThis page aims to illustrate common use cases that developers who instrument their applications and libraries with OpenTracing API need to deal with.\nStepping Back: Who is OpenTracing for?\nOpenTracing is a thin standardization layer that sits between application/library code and various systems that consume tracing and causality data.

For instance, a web middleware library can use OpenTracing to create spans for request handling, or an ORM library can use OpenTracing to describe higher-level ORM semantics and measure execution for specific SQL queries.\nOSS Services: Beyond embedded libraries, entire OSS services may adopt OpenTracing to integrate with distributed traces initiating in – or propagating to – other processes in a larger distributed system. For instance, an HTTP load balancer may use OpenTracing to decorate requests, or a distributed key:value store may use OpenTracing to explain the performance of reads and writes.\nRPC/IPC Frameworks: Any subsystem tasked with crossing process boundaries may use OpenTracing to standardize the format of tracing state as it injects into and extracts from various wire formats and protocols.\nAll of the above should be able to use OpenTracing to describe and propagate distributed traces without knowledge of the underlying OpenTracing implementation.\nOpenTracing priorities\nSince there are many orders of magnitude more programmers and applications above the OpenTracing layer (rather than below it), the APIs and use cases prioritize ease-of-use in that direction. While there are certainly ample opportunities for helper libraries and other abstractions that save time and effort for OpenTracing implementors, the use cases in this document are restricted to callers (rather than callees) of OpenTracing APIs.\nWithout further ado:\nMotivating Use Cases\nTracing a Function\ndef top_level_function():\n    span1 = tracer.start_span('top_level_function')\n    try:\n        . . . # business logic\n    finally:\n        span1.finish()\n\nAs a follow-up, suppose that as part of the business logic above we call another function2 that we also want to trace. In order to attach that function to the ongoing trace, we need a way to access span1. We discuss how it can be done later, for now let's assume we have a helper function get_current_span for that:\ndef function2():\n    span2 = get_current_span().start_child('function2') \\\n        if get_current_span() else None\n    try:\n        . . . # business logic\n    finally:\n        if span2:\n            span2.finish()\n\nWe assume that, for whatever reason, the developer does not want to start a new trace in this function if one hasn't been started by the caller already, so we account for get_current_span potentially returning None.\nThese two examples are intentionally naive. Usually developers will not want to pollute their business functions directly with tracing code, but use other means like a function decorator in Python:\n@traced_function\ndef top_level_function():\n    ... # business logic\n\nTracing Server Endpoints\nWhen a server wants to trace execution of a request, it generally needs to go through these steps:\n\nAttempt to extract a SpanContext that's been propagated alongside the incoming request (in case the trace has already been started by the client), or start a new trace if no such propagated SpanContext could be found.\nStore the newly created Span in some request context that is propagated throughout the application, either by application code, or by the RPC framework.\nFinally, close the Span using span.finish() when the server has finished processing the request.\n\nExtracting a SpanContext from an Incoming Request\nLet's assume that we have an HTTP server, and the SpanContext is propagated from the client via HTTP headers, accessible via request.headers:\nextracted_context = tracer.extract(\n    format=opentracing.HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT,\n    carrier=request.headers\n)\n\nHere we use the headers map as the carrier. The Tracer object knows which headers it needs to read in order to reconstruct the tracer state and any Baggage.\nContinuing or Starting a Trace from an Incoming Request\nThe extracted_context object above can be None if the Tracer did not find relevant headers in the incoming request: presumably because the client did not send them. In this case the server needs to start a brand new trace.\nextracted_context = tracer.extract(\n    format=opentracing.HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT,\n    carrier=request.headers\n)\nif extracted_context is None:\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation)\nelse:\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation, child_of=extracted_context)\nspan.set_tag('http.method', request.method)\nspan.set_tag('http.url', request.full_url)\n\nThe set_tag calls are examples of recording additional information in the Span about the request.\nThe operation above refers to the name the server wants to give to the Span. For example, if the HTTP request was a POST against /save_user/123, the operation name can be set to post:/save_user/. The OpenTracing API does not dictate how applications name the spans.\nIn-Process Request Context Propagation\nRequest context propagation refers to application's ability to associate a certain context with the incoming request such that this context is accessible in all other layers of the application within the same process. It can be used to provide application layers with access to request-specific values such as the identity of the end user, authorization tokens, and the request's deadline. It can also be used for transporting the current tracing Span.\nImplementation of request context propagation is outside the scope of the OpenTracing API, but it is worth mentioning them here to better understand the following sections. There are two commonly used techniques of context propagation:\nImplicit Propagation\nIn implicit propagation techniques the context is stored in platform-specific storage that allows it to be retrieved from any place in the application. Often used by RPC frameworks by utilizing such mechanisms as thread-local or continuation-local storage, or even global variables (in case of single-threaded processes).\nThe downside of this approach is that it almost always has a performance penalty, and in platforms like Go that do not support thread-local storage implicit propagation is nearly impossible to implement.\nExplicit Propagation\nIn explicit propagation techniques the application code is structured to pass around a certain context object:\nfunc HandleHttp(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n    ctx := context.Background()\n    ...\n    BusinessFunction1(ctx, arg1, ...)\n}\n\nfunc BusinessFunction1(ctx context.Context, arg1...) {\n    ...\n    BusinessFunction2(ctx, arg1, ...)\n}\n\nfunc BusinessFunction2(ctx context.Context, arg1...) {\n    parentSpan := opentracing.SpanFromContext(ctx)\n    childSpan := opentracing.StartSpan(\n        \"...\", opentracing.ChildOf(parentSpan.Context()), ...)\n    ...\n}\n\nThe downside of explicit context propagation is that it leaks what could be considered an infrastructure concern into the application code. This Go blog post provides an in-depth overview and justification of this approach.\nTracing Client Calls\nWhen an application acts as an RPC client, it is expected to start a new tracing Span before making an outgoing request, and propagate the new Span along with that request. The following example shows how it can be done for an HTTP request.\ndef traced_request(request, operation, http_client):\n    # retrieve current span from propagated request context\n    parent_span = get_current_span()\n\n    # start a new span to represent the RPC\n    span = tracer.start_span(\n        operation_name=operation,\n        child_of=parent_span.context,\n        tags={'http.url': request.full_url}\n    )\n\n    # propagate the Span via HTTP request headers\n    tracer.inject(\n        span.context,\n        format=opentracing.HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT,\n        carrier=request.headers)\n\n    # define a callback where we can finish the span\n    def on_done(future):\n        if future.exception():\n            span.log(event='rpc exception', payload=exception)\n        span.set_tag('http.status_code', future.result().status_code)\n        span.finish()\n\n    try:\n        future = http_client.execute(request)\n        future.add_done_callback(on_done)\n        return future\n    except Exception e:\n        span.log(event='general exception', payload=e)\n        span.finish()\n        raise\n\n\nThe get_current_span() function is not a part of the OpenTracing API. It is meant to represent some util method of retrieving the current Span from the current request context propagated implicitly (as is often the case in Python).\nWe assume the HTTP client is asynchronous, so it returns a Future, and we need to add an on-completion callback to be able to finish the current child Span.\nIf the HTTP client returns a future with exception, we log the exception to the Span with log method.\nBecause the HTTP client may throw an exception even before returning a Future, we use a try/catch block to finish the Span in all circumstances, to ensure it is reported and avoid leaking resources.\n\nUsing Baggage / Distributed Context Propagation\nThe client and server examples above propagated the Span/Trace over the wire, including any Baggage. The client may use the Baggage to pass additional data to the server and any other downstream server it might call.\n# client side\nspan.context.set_baggage_item('auth-token', '.....')\n\n# server side (one or more levels down from the client)\ntoken = span.context.get_baggage_item('auth-token')\n\nLogging Events\nWe have already used log in the client Span use case. Events can be logged without a payload, and not just where the Span is being created / finished. For example, the application may record a cache miss event in the middle of execution, as long as it can get access to the current Span from the request context:\nspan = get_current_span()\nspan.log(event='cache-miss')\n\nThe tracer automatically records a timestamp of the event, in contrast with tags that apply to the entire Span. It is also possible to associate an externally provided timestamp with the event, e.g. see Log (Go).\nRecording Spans With External Timestamps\nThere are scenarios when it is impractical to incorporate an OpenTracing compatible tracer into a service, for various reasons. For example, a user may have a log file of what's essentially Span data coming from a black-box process (e.g. HAProxy). In order to get the data into an OpenTracing-compatible system, the API needs a way to record spans with externally defined timestamps.\nexplicit_span = tracer.start_span(\n    operation_name=external_format.operation,\n    start_time=external_format.start,\n    tags=external_format.tags\n)\nexplicit_span.finish(\n    finish_time=external_format.finish,\n    bulk_logs=map(..., external_format.logs)\n)\n\nSetting Sampling Priority Before the Trace Starts\nMost distributed tracing systems apply sampling to reduce the amount of trace data that needs to be recorded and processed. Sometimes developers want to have a way to ensure that a particular trace is going to be recorded (sampled) by the tracing system, e.g. by including a special parameter in the HTTP request, like debug=true. The OpenTracing API standardizes around some useful tags, and one o them is the so-called \"sampling priority\": exact semnatics are implementation-specific, but any values greater than zero (the default) indicates a trace of elevated importance. In order to pass this attribute to tracing systems that rely on pre-trace sampling, the following approach can be used:\nif request.get('debug'):\n    span = tracer.start_span(\n        operation_name=operation,\n        tags={tags.SAMPLING_PRIORITY: 1}\n    )\n\n"},"pages/instrumentation/instrumenting-frameworks.html":{"url":"pages/instrumentation/instrumenting-frameworks.html","title":"Instrumenting Frameworks","keywords":"","body":"Instrumenting Frameworks\nTrace all the things!\nAudience\nThe audience for this guide are developers interested in adding OpenTracing instrumentation to a web, RPC, or other framework that makes requests and/or receives responses. This instrumentation makes it easy for developers using the framework to incorporate end-to-end (distributed) tracing.\nDistributed tracing provides insight about individual requests as they propagate throughout a system. OpenTracing is an open-source standard API for consistent distributed tracing of requests across processes, from web and mobile client platforms to the storage systems and custom backends at the bottom of an application stack. Once OpenTracing integrates across  the entire application stack, it’s easy to trace requests across the distributed system. This allows developers and operators much-needed visibility optimize and stabilize production services.\nBefore you begin, check here to make sure that there's a working OpenTracing API for your platform.\nOverview\nAt a high level, here is what you need for an OpenTracing integration:\nServer framework requirements:\n\nFilters, interceptors, middleware, or another way to process inbound requests\nActive span storage: either a request context or a request-to-span map\nSettings or another way to configure tracer configuration\n\nClient framework requirements:\n\nFilters, interceptors, or another way to process outgoing requests\nSettings or another way to configure tracing configuration\n\nPro-tips:\nBefore we dive into implementation, here are a few important concepts and features that should be made available to framework users.\nOperation Names\nYou'll notice an operation_name variable floating around this tutorial. Every span is created with an operation name that should follow the guidelines outlined here. You should have a default operation name for each span, but also provide a way for the user to specify custom operation names.\nExamples of default operation names:\n\nThe name of the request handler method\nThe name of a web resource\nThe concatenated names of an RPC service and method\n\nSpecifying Which Requests to Trace\nSome users may want to trace every request while other may want only specific requests to be traced. You should ideally allow users to set up tracing for either of these scenarios. For example, you could provide @Trace annotations/decorators, in which only annotated handler functions have tracing enabled. You can also provide settings for the user to specify whether they're using these annotations, versus whether they want all requests to be traced automatically.\nTracing Request Properties\nUsers may also want to track information about the requests without having to manually access the span and set the tags themselves. It's helpful to provide a way for users to specify properties of the request they want to trace, and then automatically trace these features. Ideally, this would be similar to the Span Decorator function in gRPC:\n// SpanDecorator binds a function that decorates gRPC Spans.\nfunc SpanDecorator(decorator SpanDecoratorFunc) Option {\n    return func(o *options) {\n        o.decorator = decorator\n    }\n}\nAnother approach could have a setting TRACED_REQUEST_ATTRIBUTES that the user can pass a list of attributes (such as URL, METHOD, or HEADERS), and then in your tracing filters, you would include the following:\nfor attr in settings.TRACED_REQUEST_ATTRIBUTES:\n    if hasattr(request, attr):\n        payload = str(getattr(request, attr))\n        span.set_tag(attr, payload)\nServer-side Tracing\nThe goals of server-side tracing are to trace the lifetime of a request to a server and connect this instrumentation to any pre-existing trace in the client. You can do this by creating spans when the server receives the request and ending the span when the server finishes processing the request. The workflow for tracing a server request is as follows:\n\nServer Receives Request\nExtract the current trace state from the inter-process transport (HTTP, etc)\nStart the span\nStore the current trace state\n\n\nServer Finishes Processing the Request / Sends Response\nFinish the span\n\n\n\nBecause this workflow depends on request processing, you'll need to know how to  change the  framework’s requests and responses handling--whether this is through filters, middleware, a configurable stack, or some other mechanism.\nExtract the Current Trace State\nIn order to trace across process boundaries in distributed systems, services need to be able to continue the trace injected by the client that sent each request. OpenTracing allows this to happen by providing inject and extract methods that encode a span's context into a carrier. (The specifics of the encoding is left to the implementor, so you won't have to worry about that.)\nIf there was an active request on the client side, the span context will already be injected into the the request. Your job is to then extract that span context using the io.opentracing.Tracer.extract method. The carrier that you'll extract from depends on which type of service you're using; web servers, for example, use HTTP headers as the carrier for HTTP requests (as shown below):\nPython:\nspan_ctx = tracer.extract(opentracing.Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)\n\nJava:\nimport io.opentracing.propagation.Format;\nimport io.opentracing.propagation.TextMap;\n\nMap headers = request.getHeaders();\nSpanContext parentSpan = tracer.getTracer().extract(Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS,\n    new TextMapExtractAdapter(headers));\n\nOpenTracing can throw errors when an extract fails due to no span being present, so make sure to catch the errors that signify there was no injected span and not crash your server. This often just means that the request is coming from a third-party (or untraced) client, and the server should start a new trace.\nStart the span\nOnce you receive a request and extract any existing span context, you should immediately start a span representing the lifetime of the request to the server. If there is an extracted span context present, then the new server span should be created with a ChildOf reference to the extracted span, signifying the relationship between the client request and server response. If there was no injected span, you'll just start a new span with no references.\nPython:\nif(extracted_span_ctx):\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation_name,\n        child_of=extracted_span_ctx)\nelse:\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation_name)\n\nJava:\nif(parentSpan == null){\n    span = tracer.buildSpan(operationName).start();\n} else {\n    span = tracer.buildSpan(operationName).asChildOf(parentSpan).start();\n}\n\nStore the current span context\nIt's important for users to be able to access the current span context while processing a request, in order to set custom tags on the span, log events, or create child spans that represent work done on behalf of the server. In order to allow for this, you have to decide how to make the span available to users. This will be dictated largely by the structure of your framework. Here are  two common cases as examples:\n\nUse of request context: If your framework has a request context that can store arbitrary values, then you can store the current span in the request context for the duration of the processing of a request. This works particularly well if your framework has filters that can alter how requests are processed. For example, if you have a request context called ctx, you could apply a filter similar to this:\n\ndef filter(request):\n    span = # extract / start span from request\n    with (ctx.active_span = span):\n        process_request(request)\n    span.finish()\n\nNow, at any point during the processing of the request, if the user accesses ctx.active_span, they'll receive the span for that request. Note that once the request is processed, ctx.active_span should retain whatever value it had before the request was processed.\n\nMap Requests to their associated span: You may not have a request context available, or you may use filters that have separate methods for preprocessing and postprocessing requests. If this is the case, you can instead create a mapping of requests to the span that represents its lifetime. One way that you could do this is to create a framework-specific tracer wrapper that stores this mapping. For example:\n\n\nclass MyFrameworkTracer:\n    def __init__(opentracing_tracer):\n        self.internal_tracer = opentracing_tracer\n        self.active_spans = {}\n    def add_span(request, span):\n        self.active_spans[request] = span\n    def get_span(request):\n        return self.active_spans[request]\n    def finish_span(request):\n        span = self.active_spans[request]\n        span.finish()\n        del self.active_spans[request]\n\nIf your server can handle multiple requests at once, then make sure that your implementation of the span map is threadsafe.\n\nThe filters would then be applied along these lines:\n\n\ndef process_request(request):\n    span = # extract / start span from request\n    tracer.add_span(request, span)\ndef process_response(request, response):\n    tracer.finish_span(request)\n\nNote that the user here can call tracer.get_span(request) during response processing to access the current span. Make sure that the request (or whatever unique request identifier you're using to map to spans) is availabe to the user.\n\nClient-side tracing\nEnabling Client-side tracing is applicable to frameworks that have a client component that is able to initiate a request. The goal is to inject a span into the header of the request that can then be passed to the server-side portion of the framework. Just like with server-side tracing, you'll need to know how to alter how your clients send requests and receive responses. When done correctly, the trace of a request is visible end-to-end.\nWorkflow for server side tracing:\n\nPrepare request\nLoad the current trace state\nStart a span\nInject the span into the request\n\n\nSend request\nReceive response\nFinish the span\n\n\n\nLoad the Current Trace State / Start a Span\nJust like on the server side, we have to recognize whether we need to start a new trace or connect with an already-active trace. For instance, most microservices act as both client and server within the larger distributed system, and their outbound client requests should be associated with whatever request the service was handling at the time. If there's an active trace, you'll start a span for the client request with the active span as its parent. Otherwise, the span you start will have no parent.\nHow you recognize whether there is an active trace depends on how you're storing active spans. If you're using a request context, then you can do something like this:\nif hasattr(ctx, active_span):\n    parent_span = getattr(ctx, active_span)\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation_name,\n        child_of=parent_span)\nelse:\n    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name=operation_name)\nIf you're using the request-to-span mapping technique, your approach might look like:\nparent_span = tracer.get_span(request)\nspan = tracer.start_span(\n    operation_name=operation_name,\n    child_of=parent_span)\nYou can see examples of this approach in gRPC and JDBI.\nInject the Span\nThis is where you pass the trace information into the client's request so that the server you send it to can continue the trace. If you're sending an HTTP request, then you'll just use the HTTP headers as your carrier.\nspan = # start span from the current trace state\ntracer.inject(span, opentracing.Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)\nFinish the Span\nWhen you receive a response, you want to end the span to signify that the client request is finished. Just like on the server side, how you do this depends on how your client request/response processing happens. If your filter wraps the request directly you can just do this:\ndef filter(request, response):\n    span = # start span from the current trace state\n    tracer.inject(span, opentracing.Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)\n    response = send_request(request)\n    if response.error:\n       span.set_tag(opentracing., true)\n    span.finish()\nOtherwise, if you have ways to process the request and response separately, you might extend your tracer to include a mapping of client requests to spans, and your implementation would look more like this:\ndef process_request(request):\n    span = # start span from the current trace state\n    tracer.inject(span. opentracing.Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)\n    tracer.add_client_span(request, span)\ndef process_response(request, response):\n    tracer.finish_client_span(request)\nClosing Remarks\nOnce you've packaged your implementation, email us at community@opentracing.io with your implementation details (platform, description, github username) and we'll create a repo for you under opentracing-contrib, so that others will be able to find and use your integration. You can also find there concrete examples of OpenTracing integrations into different open source projects.\nIf you're interested in learning more about OpenTracing, join the conversation by joining our mailing list or Gitter.\n"},"pages/concepts-and-terminology.html":{"url":"pages/concepts-and-terminology.html","title":"Concepts and Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Concepts and Terminology\nCausal relationships for Spans in a single trace\n\n\n        [Span A]  ←←←(the root span)\n            |\n     +------+------+\n     |             |\n [Span B]      [Span C] ←←←(Span C is a \"ChildOf\" Span A)\n     |             |\n [Span D]      +---+-------+\n               |           |\n           [Span E]    [Span F] >>> [Span G] >>> [Span H]\n                                       ↑\n                                       ↑\n                                       ↑\n                         (Span G \"FollowsFrom\" Span F)\nTemporal relationships for all of the above\n\n\n––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–> time\n\n [Span A···················································]\n   [Span B··············································]\n      [Span D··········································]\n    [Span C········································]\n         [Span E·······]        [Span F··] [Span G··] [Span H··]\nTraces\nA Trace represents the potentially distributed, potentially concurrent data/execution path in a (potentially distributed, potentially concurrent) system. A Trace can be thought of as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of Spans.\nSpans\nA Span represents a logical unit of work in the system that has a start time and a duration. Spans may be nested and ordered to model causal relationships.\nOperation Names\nEach Span has an operation name, a human-readable string which concisely represents the work done by the Span (e.g., an RPC method name, a function name, or the name of a subtask or stage within a larger computation). The operation name should be the most general (i.e., least specific) string that identifies a (statistically) interesting class of Span instances; more specific sub-classes should be described using Tags.\nFor example, here are potential operation names for a Span that gets hypothetical account information:\n\n\n\nOperation Name\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\nget\nToo general\n\n\nget_account/792\nToo specific\n\n\nget_account\nGood, and account_id=792 would make a nice Tag\n\n\n\n\nCausal Span References\nA Span may reference zero or more Spans that are causally related. OpenTracing presently defines two types of references: ChildOf and FollowsFrom. Both reference types specifically model direct causal relationships between a child Span and a parent Span. In the future, OpenTracing may also support reference types for spans with non-causal relationships (e.g., Spans that are batched together, Spans that are stuck in the same queue, etc).\nChildOf references: A Span may be the \"ChildOf\" a parent Span. In a \"ChildOf\" reference, the parent Span depends on the child Span in some capacity. All of the following would constitute ChildOf relationships:\n\nA Span representing the server side of an RPC may be the ChildOf a Span representing the client side of that RPC\nA Span representing a SQL insert may be the ChildOf a Span representing an ORM save method\nMany Spans doing concurrent (perhaps distributed) work may all individually be the ChildOf a single parent Span that merges the results for all children that return within a deadline\n\nThese could all be valid timing diagrams for children that are the \"ChildOf\" a parent.\n    [-Parent Span---------]\n         [-Child Span----]\n\n    [-Parent Span--------------]\n         [-Child Span A----]\n          [-Child Span B----]\n        [-Child Span C----]\n         [-Child Span D---------------]\n         [-Child Span E----]\nFollowsFrom references: Some parent Spans do not depend in any way on the result of their child Spans. In these cases, we say merely that the child Span \"FollowsFrom\" the parent Span in a causal sense. There are many distinct \"FollowsFrom\" reference sub-categories, and in future versions of OpenTracing they may be distinguished more formally.\nThese can all be valid timing diagrams for children that \"FollowFrom\" a parent.\n    [-Parent Span-]  [-Child Span-]\n\n\n    [-Parent Span--]\n     [-Child Span-]\n\n\n    [-Parent Span-]\n                [-Child Span-]\nLogs\nEvery Span has zero or more Logs, each of which being a timestamped event name, optionally accompanied by a structured data payload of arbitrary size. The event name should be the stable identifier for some notable moment in the lifetime of a Span. For instance, a Span representing a browser page load might add an event for each field in Performance.timing.\nWhile it is not a formal requirement, specific event names should apply to many Span instances: tracing systems can use these event names (and timestamps) to analyze Spans in the aggregate.  For more information, see the Data Semantics Guidelines.\n\nTags\nEvery Span may also have zero or more key:value Tags, which do not have timestamps and simply annotate the spans.\nAs is the case with Logs, if certain known tag key:values are used for common application scenarios, tracers can choose to pay special attention to them. For more information, see the Data Semantics Guidelines.\nSpanContext\nEvery Span must provide access to a SpanContext. The SpanContext represents Span state that must propagate to child Spans and across process boundaries (e.g., a  tuple) and also encapsulates any Baggage (see below). SpanContext is used when propagating traces across process boundaries and when creating edges in the trace graph (e.g., ChildOf relationships or other references).\nBaggage\nBaggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in a SpanContext and propagated in-band to all child Spans and their SpanContexts: in this way, the \"Baggage\" travels with the trace, hence the name. Given a full-stack OpenTracing integration, Baggage enables powerful functionality by transparently propagating arbitrary application data: for example, an end-user id may be added as a Baggage item in a mobile app, propagate (via the distributed tracing machinery) into the depths of a storage system, and recovered at the bottom of the stack to identify a particularly expensive SQL query.\nBaggage comes with powerful costs as well; since the Baggage is propagated in-band, if it is too large or the items too numerous it may decrease system throughput or increase RPC latencies.\nBaggage vs. Span Tags\n\nBaggage is propagated in-band (i.e., alongside the actual application data) across process boundaries. Span Tags are not propagated since they are not inherited by child Spans.\nSpan Tags are recorded out-of-band from the application data, presumably in the tracing system's storage. Implementations may choose to also record Baggage out-of-band, though that decision is not dictated by the OpenTracing specification.\n\nAlso, Baggage keys have a restricted format: implementations may wish to use them as HTTP header keys (or key suffixes), and of course HTTP headers are case insensitive. As such, Baggage keys MUST match the regular expression (?i:[a-z0-9][-a-z0-9]*), and – per the ?i: – they are case-insensitive. That is, the Baggage key must start with a letter or number, and the remaining characters must be letters, numbers, or hyphens.\nInject and Extract\nSpanContexts may be Injected into and Extracted from Carrier objects that are used for inter-process communication (e.g., HTTP headers). In this way, SpanContexts may propagate across process boundaries along with sufficient information to reference Spans (and thus continue traces) from remote processes.\nPlatform-Independent API Semantics\nOpenTracing supports a number of different platforms, and of course the per-platform APIs try to adhere to the idioms and conventions of their respective language and platform (i.e., they \"do as the Romans do\"). That said, each platform API must model a common set of semantics for the core tracing concepts described above. In this section we attempt to describe those concepts and semantics in a language- and platform-agnostic fashion.\nThe Span Interface\nThe Span interface must have the following capabilities:\n\nGet the Span's SpanContext (even after the Span has finished, per Finish just below)\nFinish the (already-started) Span. With the exception of calls to retrieve the SpanContext, Finish must be the last call made to any span instance. (py: finish, go: Finish) Some implementations may record information about active Spans before they are Finished (e.g., for long-lived Span instances), or Finish may never be called due to host process failure or programming errors. Implementations should clearly document the Span durability guarantees they provide in such cases.\nSet a key:value tag on the Span. The key must be a string, and the value must be either a string, a boolean, or a numeric type. Behavior for other value types is undefined. If multiple values are set to the same key (i.e., in multiple calls), implementation behavior is also undefined. (py: set_tag, go: SetTag)\nAdd a new log event to the Span, accepting an event name string and an optional structured payload argument. If specified, the payload argument may be of any type and arbitrary size, though implementations are not required to retain all payload arguments (or even all parts of all payload arguments). An optional timestamp can be used to specify a past timestamp. (py: log, go: Log)\n\nThe SpanContext Interface\nThe SpanContext interface must have the following capabilities. The user acquires a reference to a SpanContext via an associated Span instance or via Tracer's Extract capability.\n\nSet a Baggage item, represented as a simple string:string pair. Note that newly-set Baggage items are only guaranteed to propagate to future children of the associated Span. See the diagram below. (py: set_baggage_item, go: SetBaggageItem)\nGet a Baggage item by key. (py: get_baggage_item, go: BaggageItem)\n\n        [Span A]\n            |\n     +------+------+\n     |             |\n [Span B]      [Span C] ←←← (1) BAGGAGE ITEM \"X\" IS SET ON SPAN C,\n     |             |            BUT AFTER SPAN E ALREADY STARTED.\n [Span D]      +---+-----+\n               |         |\n           [Span E]  [Span F] >>> [Span G] >>> [Span H]\n                                                 ↑\n                                                 ↑\n                                                 ↑\n             (2) BAGGAGE ITEM \"X\" IS AVAILABLE FOR\n                 RETRIEVAL BY SPAN H (A CHILD OF\n                 SPAN C), AS WELL AS SPANS F AND G.\n\nThough formally part of the Tracer interface, SpanContext is essential to Inject and Extract below\n\nThe Tracer Interface\nThe Tracer interface must have the following capabilities:\n\nStart a new Span. The caller can specify zero or more SpanContext references (e.g., FollowsFrom or ChildOf), an explicit start timestamp (other than \"now\"), and an initial set of Span tags. (py: start_span, go: StartSpan)\nInject a SpanContext into a \"carrier\" object for cross-process propagation. The type of the carrier is either determined through reflection or an explicit format identifier. See the end-to-end propagation example to make this more concrete.\nExtract a SpanContext given a \"carrier\" object whose contents crossed a process boundary. Extract examines the carrier and tries to reconstruct the previously-Injected SpanContext instance. Unless there's an error, Extract returns a SpanContext which can be used in the host process like any other, most likely to start a new (child) Span. (Note that some OpenTracing implementations consider the Spans on either side of an RPC to have the same identity, and others consider the client to be the parent and the server to be the child) The type of the carrier is either determined through language reflection or an explicit format. See the end-to-end propagation example to make this more concrete.\n\nGlobal and No-op Tracers\nA per-platform OpenTracing API library (e.g., opentracing-go, opentracing-java, etc; not OpenTracing Tracer implementations) must provide a no-op Tracer as part of their interface. The no-op Tracer implementation must not crash and should have no side-effects, including baggage propagation. The Tracer implementation must provide a no-op Span implementation as well; in this way, the instrumentation code that relies on Span instances returned by the Tracer does not need to change to accommodate the possibility of no-op implementations. The no-op Tracer's Inject method should always succeed, and Extract should always behave as if no SpanContext could be found in the carrier.\nThe per-platform OpenTracing API libraries may provide support for configuring (Go: InitGlobalTracer(), py: opentracing.tracer = myTracer) and retrieving (Go: GlobalTracer(), py: opentracing.tracer) a global/singleton Tracer instance. If a global Tracer is supported, the default must be the no-op Tracer.\n"},"pages/authors-and-contributors.html":{"url":"pages/authors-and-contributors.html","title":"Authors and Contributors","keywords":"","body":"Authors and Contributors\n(in alphabetical order)\n\n@adriancole (Adrian Cole)\n@bcronin (Ben Cronin)\n@bensigelman (Ben Sigelman)\n@bg451 (Brandon Gonzalez)\n@dkuebric (Dan Kuebrich)\n@michaelsembwever (mck)\n@slimsag (Stephen Gutekanst)\n@tschottdorf (Tobias Schottdorf)\n@yurishkuro (Yuri Shkuro)\n\n"},"pages/supported-tracer.html":{"url":"pages/supported-tracer.html","title":"Supported Tracers","keywords":"","body":"Supported Tracer Implementations\nAppdash\nAppdash (background reading) is a lightweight, Golang-based distributed tracing system, originally developed and since open-sourced by sourcegraph.
